# Couples' money arrangements in Germany:<br>A visualization of cohort, age group, and partnership type variations

### [Marcel Raab](https://marcelraab.de/) & [Florian Schulz](https://flociologist.github.io/) 


This repository contains the code files required to reproduce the figures and tables in our data visualization paper published in [Socius](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/SRD). 


## Instructions for replication

The code is organized within the structure of an RStudio Project and works best when you work
with RStudio and by opening the corresponding .Rproj file (`CoupleMoney.Rproj`) either within
RStudio or by double-clicking on it. Of course, the code will also work if you do not use RStudio.
Then, however, you have to ensure that your starting working directory is the root folder of this
project (i.e., the folder that contains the R scripts and the .Rproj file). We used RStudio (2024.04.2 Build 764) 
with R version 4.4.0.


The visualization, supplementary tables, and figure are based on data from the [German Family Panel (pairfam), release 13.0](https://doi.org/10.4232/pairfam.5678.13.0.0){target="_blank"}. The data is available for scientific purposes from GESIS Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences. For this project, we only use two filesÂ , `anchor1.dta` and `anchor9.dta`, stored in Stata's .dta format.

To replicate our analysis, you need to download these files to the folder `/data/pairfam` and run the R scripts in the intended order: 


- `01_data.R`: imports the original pairfam files and prepares them for producing plots and tables
- `02_plot.R`: produces the visualization shown in the paper
- `03_plot_annotated.R`: produces the visualization shown in the paper with some additional annotations (see figure shown below)
- `04_plot_parental.R`: produces the plot shown in the Supplement
- `05_tables.R`: produces the tables shown in the Supplement

The supplement website, `Supplement.html`, can be reproduced by rendering `Supplement.qmd`.This file draws on data, tables, and figures generated by the five R scripts, so make sure to run them first before rendering `Supplement.qmd`. In addition, the .qmd file uses a screenshot from the pairfam questionnaire (`/images/Q-248.png`), a BibTeX bibliography (`references.bib`) a Citation Style Language file (`asa.csl`), and theme scss file (`custom.scss`).
